IDB Distribution Mechanism
The IDB tokens are issued based on the Ethereum blockchain for the financing of the project development. After the IDBook mainnet is launched, it will credit the appropriate number of IDB tokens, with IDB distributed 1:1 from a registered Ethereum address to the linked IDB address on the IDBook blockchain.
Once the IDB tokens are sold, there is no guarantee that anyone will repo or redeem it. IDB, as a virtual commodity with practical uses, is neither a security nor a speculative investment tool, and at the same time it does not represent any real-world assets or rights. 
Based on underlying blockchain technologies such as smart contracts, which ensure the transparent operation of IDB, the transactions can be traced and the revenue is clearer. This mechanism ensures that the IDB holders can enjoy their rights fairly, justly and transparently.
IDB will be circulated in the IDBook ecosystem, will be listed on major exchanges and can be traded on the digital asset exchanges according to their own needs. 
IDBook will issue 75 billion IDB tokens in total. There will be no additional issuance in the future.


IDB Consumption Mechanism
For those who are applying to set up non-registered digital institutions on the IDBook chain, part of the IDB tokens need to be provided as a credit guarantee. This part of IDB will be locked in accordance with the registration period. After registration, 1% of the locked guaranteed IDB will be destroyed by transferal into an invalid address. The invalid address will be published on the project's official website and will be subject to the joint supervision of all community users.

IDB Release Mechanism
Part of the IDB which belongs to the 51% reserved for the ecosystem development will be unlocked through identity exchanging gradually according to the number of new users registered. For every 100,000 new users registered into the IDBOOK ecosystem, the IDBOOK will unlock 1 million IDB to ensure efficient operations.
If the unlocked IDB tokens have already been totally released in the identity exchanging before reaching the next unlock trigger condition, no new token will be generated until the next user volume condition is reached.
